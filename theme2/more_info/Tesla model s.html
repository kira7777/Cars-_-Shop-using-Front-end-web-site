                    <p><span>T</span>he Tesla Model S is an all-electric five-door liftback sedan, produced by Tesla, Inc., and introduced on June 22, 2012. As of March 2020, the Model S Long Range Plus has an EPA range of 390 miles (630 km), which is higher than any other battery electric car.

Model S cars built after October 2016 have a feature called Autopilot, which is an advanced driver assistance system that allows the car to operate without assistance from the driver (but the driver must supervise continuously and take control if there is an issue). Autopilot 2.0 also includes Enhanced Summon, which allows the car to navigate through a parking lot to come to you, without anyone in the driver's seat.[14] Sentry mode, available on cars built after August 2017,is a feature which senses and records suspicious activity around the car.

In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, twice leading in Norway, in September and December 2013 and also in Denmark in December 2015.Global Model S sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018 (more recent numbers are not available because Tesla combines sales of Model S and Model X). The U.S. is its leading market, with about 140,000 units delivered through December 2018.

The Tesla Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, and by the end of 2018 continued to rank as the second most-sold electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf. The December 2017 Consumer Reports owner satisfaction survey had the Tesla Model S at the top for all cars; in December 2019, it's in fifth position. In 2019, the US magazine Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate car of the year over the magazine's 70-year history.</p>
